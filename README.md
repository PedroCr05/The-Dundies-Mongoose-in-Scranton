## Getting started

1. Fork
1. Clone

# Exercise

Using the mongo-mongoose-queries lesson, implement the following in JavaScript:

1. Create an `employeesDatabase`. It will have 2 collecitions, Companies and Employees

Here is an example of the design for your Company  model:


```js
{
 _id: ObjectId("70ed7af8f25e417175c82f04"),
company_name: "Dunder Mifflin",
location: "Scranton, PA",
product: "paper",
type: "private",
established: 2003
}
```

and your Employee data model:
```js
{
    _id: ObjectId("5e417175c82e0bd7af0f2f04"),
    company_id: dunderMifflin[0]._id, 
    first_name: "Dwight",
    last_name: "Shrute",
    email: "DShrute@dm.com",
    job_title: "salesman
    salary_in_usd: 65000,
    address: {
        street: "123 Beet St",
        city: "Scranton",
        state: "PA",
        zip: 20010
    }
}

```
##
2. Implement the above models with a schema for each. You can add or change up any of the properties, but make sure both models have at least 2 different data types, plus the nested object in the Employee model. This is a trickier model because it has an embedded document. You will have to research the [Mongoose Docs](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/subdocs.html) on how to implement a subdocument in your model

##

3. Create a seed file with 3 companies, and  3 employees for each
   
##

4. Create a query file with the following queries:
  
    -  return a list of all employees' full names (first_name + last_name) from one company
      - hint: you can use [projections](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#model_Model.find) to solve this
    - update one company to go "Public". Buy stock before the IPO is released, then avoid insider trading charges by the SEC
    - update one employee's salary, give them a $10,000 raise
    - Why pay big city rent when we can work from home somewhere in the suburbs? Update another employee's City to be somewhere a few miles away
    - delete an employee
    - they're closing the Stamford branch! Delete all employees from one company
    

## Bonus

Use [chance](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chance) npm package to generate employees in your seed file instead. Run 'npm install chance' in your root folder (the one that has the package.json file) and use chance to generate fake data with ease!

```js
const chance = require('Chance')
///

const chance = new Chance()

///


const employees = [...Array(10)].map(employee => (
    {
        first_name: chance.first(),
        last_name: chance.last(),
        email: chance.email(),
        job_title: chance.profession(),
        salary_in_usd: chance.integer({ min: 30000, max: 100000 }),
        address: {
            street: chance.word(),
            city: chance.city(),
            state: chance.state(),
            zip: chance.integer({ min: 10001, max: 99999 })
        }
    }
))
```
